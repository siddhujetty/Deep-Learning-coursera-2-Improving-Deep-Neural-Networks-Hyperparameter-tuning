Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

Instructor: Andrew Ng

Introduction

This repo contains my work for the course. All the code base and programming assignments are taken from Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization part of Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

Currently, this repo has weekly programming assignments done for the course.
